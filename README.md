# PlaneGame
A simple arcade flight physics project.

Inspired by Ace Combat and a few creators I wanted to try making a fun to use arcade flight system.
Bare flight physics tutorial: b3agz (YT: b3agz)
F15 Model: Vazgriz (YT: Vazgriz)

<b>Goal:</b> Create a fun flight model that incorporates many flight mechanics from Ace Combat with a more arcade feel.
<b>Team:</b> 1
<b>Results:</b> The end result is a fairly simple flight model that dynamically changes lift based off your angle of attack. Mechanics such as high-g turns are carried over from Ace Combat while allowing for a fine level of vehicle control. I implemented dashing with a double tap action as a proof of concept for potentail future mechanics.
 
<b>How to run:</b>
- Download the GameBuild folder.
- Run Plane Game.exe
